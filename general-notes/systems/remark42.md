# remark42

## Installation

If you can't start up on port 80, then follow [this answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/244534) to kill what's on port 80:

```
$ sudo lsof -t -i tcp:80 -s tcp:listen | sudo xargs kill
```

### Let's Encrypt SSL

To get SSL set up, we try to follow the instructions [here](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&os=pip):

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-venv libaugeas0
$ sudo python3 -m venv /opt/certbot/

This certificate expires on 2025-05-18.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- The certificate will need to be renewed before it expires. Certbot can automatically renew the certificate in the background, but you may need to take steps to enable that functionality. See https://certbot.org/renewal-setup for instructions.

It turns out there's [problems](https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-unable-to-mount-bind-letsencrypt-folder/138952) with mounting `/etc` from the host to the container due to the Docker VM's own `/etc` being used instead. So, we copy the files over to a directory that we can mount:

```bash
$ mkdir ssl
$ sudo cp -R /etc/letsencrypt/live/comments.zamm.dev/ ./ssl
```

We now edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to include the following:

```yaml
    environment:
      ...
      - AUTH_ANON=true
      - SSL_TYPE=static
      - SSL_CERT=/srv/ssl/fullchain.pem
      - SSL_KEY=/srv/ssl/privkey.pem
      ...
    volumes:
      ...
      - ./ssl:/srv/ssl:ro

```

### Telegram Auth and notification

We try following the Telegram instructions [here](https://remark42.com/docs/configuration/telegram/), and then edit `docker-compose.yml` to include the following:

```yaml
    environment:
      ...
      - TELEGRAM_TOKEN=...
      - AUTH_TELEGRAM=true
      - NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_CHAN=-100...
      - NOTIFY_ADMINS=telegram
      - NOTIFY_USERS=telegram
      ...
```

where you get the private channel ID by following [these instructions](https://neliosoftware.com/content/help/how-do-i-get-the-channel-id-in-telegram/) and going to [web.telegram.org](https://web.telegram.org/) and adding `-100` in front of the channel ID.

We get this error on the server when we try to login with Telegram:

```
remark42  | 2025/02/17 16:25:38.052 [DEBUG] {middleware/auth.go:75 middleware.(*Authenticator).Auth.(*Authenticator).auth.func1} auth failed, can't get token: token cookie was not presented: http: named cookie not present
```

It turns out this is a red herring; the real problem appears to not having set `NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_CHAN` at first.

### Facebook Auth

If you get an error such as "exchange failed", it is likely because you have [confused](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72679535) the app secret with the client token. The app secret looks like the last screenshot [here](https://help.keragon.com/hc/en-us/articles/21882995443218-How-to-find-your-OAuth-2-0-client-credentials-in-Facebook-for-conversions).

You will also need to add the valid callback URL in the settings for the login use case.

### Discord Auth

Discord Auth turns out to [not be available yet](https://github.com/umputun/remark42/issues/1880), despite what the documentation says.

### Admin

We make a comment with our logged-in user, and then do

```yaml
    environment:
      ...
      - ADMIN_SHARED_ID=telegram_...
      ...
```

The admin UI doesn't appear at first. It turns out you need to log out first and log back in.

### Running on server startup

We can try following [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39493500) and editing `/etc/systemd/system/docker-remark42.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=ZAMM Comments Service
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose -f /path/... up
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose -f /path/... down

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

and then

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable docker-remark42.service
```

Initially, we get a problem when we try starting it manually:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start docker-remark42.service
$ sudo systemctl status docker-remark42.service
Ã— docker-remark42.service - ZAMM Comments Service

```

Turns out the problem is `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`. The problem is already fixed in the original example. As mentioned [here](https://serverfault.com/a/700956), we have to do

```bash
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl start docker-remark42.service
```

to actually apply the fix.

Next, we disable the existing Apache server:

```bash
$ systemctl stop apache2.service
$ systemctl disable apache2.service

```

It still fails on startup because port 80 is blocked. We see what's up:

```
$ lsof -t -i:80                       
845
846
847
848
849
$ ps -p 845       
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
    845 ?        00:00:00 nginx
```

It finally runs on startup.
